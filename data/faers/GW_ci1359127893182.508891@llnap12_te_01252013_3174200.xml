			<summary>
				<narrativeincludeclinical>This is a spontaneous report from a non-clinical-study program Pfizer Helpful Answers, information received from a contactable consumer and contactable physician.
This 58-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity reported that she started taking estrogens conjugated (PREMARIN) 0.625mg oral tablets once a day as her uterus was removed on an unknown date. Relevant medical history included trigeminal neuralgia in four nerves and she had a trigeminal neuralgia attack on an unknown date due to which she had four unspecified procedures and five brain surgeries, brain injury in 1999 due to which she put on disability and it was unknown whether these conditions were ongoing at the time of this report, in addition her uterus was removed. Relevant concomitant medications included unspecified medications and she was still taking all the concomitant medications. On an unknown date, while on estrogens conjugated 0.625mg once a day, she was scheduled for a gall bladder surgery on 17Dec2012. Relevant laboratory data was none. At the time of this report it was unknown whether she was taking estrogens conjugated and the clinical outcome of the event was unknown.
Additionally, a contactable physician stated that she/he was informed by patient regarding the adverse event with the use of the product, and she/he confirmed occurrence of event.

Follow-up (22Jan2013): 
New information received from the contactable physician included communication between patient and physician and confirmation of occurrences.
Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.</narrativeincludeclinical>
				<sendercomment>On the basis of the available information, a possible causal relationship between the onset of the reported event and treatment with conjugated estrogens cannot be ruled out.</sendercomment>
