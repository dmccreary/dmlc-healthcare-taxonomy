On 26-Feb-2007 she was on Alesse BCPs but not taking as dir (as directed) - she skipped pills/ took them late. She wanted to change to YASMIN. She had bleeding secondary to poor compliance with BCP.
She took Gardasil that day. She was on YASMIN for 3 months.
On 23-Mar-2007 she was on YASMIN.
29-Jun-2007 she took 2 Gardasil.
On 23-Jul-2007 she used spermicide and condoms.
On 06-Oct-2007 she was dropped by a friend and fell onto her right elbow on concrete from approximately 3.5 feet at midnight the previous night. Her medications included BCP.
On 09-Oct-2007 she had 10 days of intermittent diarrhea and vomited once 4-5 days ago. She had no travel or camping history and she otherwise felt well. Her medication included BCP.  Assessment was gastroenteritis. She was on Imodium and Septra DS.
On 19-Oct-2007 her chief complaint was rib pain when breathing. Her medications included YASMIN.
She had epigastric and abdominal pain for the past 3 days and complained of constant, intense, burning type abdominal pain which radiated into the left side of her flank then up into her left shoulder and left rib cage. Diagnosis was tachycardia, atypical chest pain and abdominal pain - epigastric. She had elevated  D-Dimer and RF (risk factors), namely tobacco use and OCP (oral contraceptive pill) use - c/w (consistent with) PE (pulmonary embolism). She was transferred to ED (emergency department) for further care.
On 20-Oct-2007 her chief complaint was chest pain. She apparently was at urgent care that day with some difficulty breathing and left sided chest pain, and d dimer was elevated. She was sent to the emergency room for evaluation and treatment. She had been having pain over the past 3  days, which was more severe with deep inspiration. She had no leg pain, no other associated signs or symptoms or modifying factors. Her medications included birth control pills. Diagnosis was acute pulmonary embolism.
On 20-Oct-2007 she had no significant past medical history of birth control pills. On Tuesday, she developed severe left sided chest pain with difficulty breathing secondary to pleuritic chest pain. She did not have any cough or sputum production. She had no hemoptysis or pain in the lower extremity. She had no known history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and no family history of hypercoagulable state. She did not seek any medical attention until the pain became quite worse and subsequently presented to the urgent care and she was then referred to hospital where she underwent a spiral CT (computed tomography) of the chest, which did confirm the presence of LEFT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY EMBOLISM. It showed multiple filling defects are present within the pulmonary vasculature leading to the left lower lobe. This was consistent with acute pulmonary emboli. There was a small pleural effusion. Her current medication included birth control pills. She had no known allergies. She was told not to go back on birth control pills. She had already been started on Lovenox. She was to undergo a hypercoagulable work up and was also started on Coumadin. She was to be kept on Coumadin for at least 6 months as an outpatient.
On 20-Oct-2007 she presented to the emergency room the previous day with 3 days of shortness of breath and left sided chest pain. She has no prior history of thromboembolic events and no family history of DVT (deep venous thrombosis) or pulmonary emboli. She has no recent surgery or immobilization. She has been on oral contraceptives for over a year. She has 2 known risk factors for pulmonary embolus including oral contraceptives and smoking. She was encouraged to stop smoking and discontinue oral contraceptives. She was to remain on Coumadin for at least 6 months.
On 24-Oct-2007 as per Discharge Summary, her date of admission was 20-Oct-2007. She was on birth control pills and presented with severe left sided chest pain and was found to have LEFT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY EMBOLISM with development of small pleural effusion. She was started on Lovenox and then was given Coumadin. Her clinical condition significantly improved. Discharge diagnosis was left sided pulmonary embolism with small pleural effusion. INR (international normalized ratio) was 2.2 that day. A prescription was also given for iron supplementation.
On 29-Oct-2007 she reported spont (spontaneous) PE on OCPs YASMIN and smoking. She was not taking OCPs. She had left pleural effusion and pain on left side. She was taking Vicodin. She experienced PE secondary to Tob (tobacco)/ OCPs. INR was 2.1 that day.
On 01-Nov-2007 she presented for evaluation of nausea. She had been diagnosed with PE 2 weeks ago, and had been out of the hospital for 10 days and was currently doing well on her warfarin. She still had a lot of left sided chest pain but it was not worse.
On 17-Nov-2007 she presented to the emergency room with complaints of left sided pleuritic chest pain. The pain was worse with deep breathing and coughing. She had a similar presentation about 4 weeks ago, when she was first hospitalized with an acute pulmonary embolism, as well as some difficulty breathing, more related to the pleuritic pain. She continued to smoke a few cigarettes a day.
Her current medications included Coumadin. Impression was left sided pleuritic chest pain. She was on subtherapeutic anticoagulation. She had recent history of pulmonary embolism. She was to be admitted to the telemetry unit and to be continued on her Coumadin. She was to be placed on Lovenox.
On 22-Nov-2007 as per Discharge Summary, her date of admission was 17-Nov-2007. Discharge diagnosis was pulmonary embolism. She had subtherapeutic INR. She was hospitalized with complaints of left sided pleuritic chest pain. She had an elevated D-Dimer. She had a history of a recent pulmonary embolism. At the time of discharge, her oxygenation was stable. Her INR was up to 1.8. Her family members were instructed on how to give her Lovenox. Medications at time of discharge were Coumadin, Lovenox and Percocet.
On 26-Nov-2007 she reported allergy to Yazmin [as written]. She was readmitted with subther (subtherapeutic) INR and increased CP (chest pain), dxd (diagnosed) as pleuritic effusion. She was feeling better. INR was 2.2 that day, and Lovenox was stopped.
On 02-Dec-2007 her chief complaint ruled out PE. She had chest pain, since Friday, and it was now Sunday evening. She had prior left sided chest pain that was a PE. That presentation was different, with severe shortness of breath and severe pain. She was a smoker 1-2 packs a week and the prior pulmonary embolism apparently was large, requiring her to be on Coumadin which she still took, but she had had some low subtherapeutic INR in the last couple checks despite verbal phone call adjustments [as written]. She said she had been compliant with the medication. Diagnosis was pneumonia and chest pain, unspecified. She was discharged home with prescription for Zithromax.
On 27-Dec-2007 she was there to establish care. She had H/O (history of) PE in Oct-2007 when on BCP and occ (occasional) smoking. She was now on Coumadin but was having trouble getting to goal INR of 2.5-3.0.
on 05-May-2008 her complaint was left sided chest pain. She had a history of pulmonary embolism which she had due to a birth control pill and cigarette smoking. She stated that she was treated with Coumadin and had resolution and then after a full course of Coumadin, she went off the Coumadin and was now embarking on an exercise program. Diagnostic impression was chest wall pain related to musculoskeletal etiology, related to her recent zealous workout routine. Her prescriptions were for Hydrocodone/APAP and Ibuprofen.
On 09-Jun-2008 she wanted to discuss contraception. She was status post PE probably secondary to smoking and birth control pills. She was on Coumadin until 2 months ago and she was off it now and wanted to try some other form of birth control. She discussed IUD (interpreted as intrauterine device).
On 12-Jun-2008 she scheduled a Mirena insertion.
On 15-Sep-2008 she was supposed to see Heme (hematologist) but didn't go. She had no current sx (symptoms) and was not on BC (birth control).
On 06-Oct-2008 her reason for consultation was evaluation and recommendations for history of pulmonary embolus. She was hospitalized in Oct-2007 for shortness of breath and left sided chest pain. She was smoking at the time and taking birth control pills, both of which activities had ceased. She took Coumadin for 6 months and had been off since Apr-2008. She currently felt well. She smoked for 4 years but quit. Impression was status post unprovoked pulmonary embolus, in Oct-2007, with negative lower extremity ultrasound. She had negative coagulopathy panel in Dec-2007, except for low protein C and protein S levels which were probably due to her Coumadin therapy. She was to repeat protein C and protein S now.
On 05-Dec-2009 she had upper back and neck pain for1 day. She rear ended a car going 50 miles per hour the previous day. Diagnosis was neck sprain.

As per PR,
YASMIN was dispensed on 26-Feb-2007 and 17-Sep-2007.

Other lab tests were provided, see the sections Lab Data and Relevant Tests for more information.

				<sendercomment>BAYER GLOBAL COMMENT: 
This case report was received from an attorney in the form of Medical records on behalf of a 17 years old female patient, who was prescribed Yasmin (drospirenone and ethinylestradiol) and experienced LEFT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE).
PE is serious due to hospitalization and listed event in the Reference Safety Information for Yasmin. 
Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between the use of COCs and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases such as DVT and PE. These events occur rarely and the risk is highest during the first year of use.
Risk factors include prolonged immobilization (including plane and automobile travel), trauma (resulting in deep vein thrombosis, which in turn may lead to PE formation), thrombophilia (such as possession of the Leiden Factor V mutation), cancer, infection, older age, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, use of certain drugs (eg, cocaine, amphetamines), a family history of thromboembolic event or the use of combination oral contraceptives. 
Risk factors in this case include smoking, recent history of Fall on right elbow and family history of thromboembolic event.
Temporal relationship is positive between PE and Yasmin, hence causality cannot be excluded.
Further information is expected during litigation process.</sendercomment>
