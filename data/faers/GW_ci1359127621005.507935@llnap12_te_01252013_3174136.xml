			<summary>
				<narrativeincludeclinical>This spontaneous case, reported by a consumer, with additional information provided by a physician, concerns a 7 year old Caucasian male. 

Relevant medical history included cleft lip and palate, and surgery to repair his hard palate on unknown date. He was born with a congenital anomaly called CHARGE syndrome which included craniofacial abnormalities. Concomitant medications were not provided.

The patient received somatropin (Humatrope) 1.3 mg, unknown frequency, from a 12mg cartridge, because of a charge syndrome which affected his pituatary which caused him to have low growth hormone, beginning in 2008. In Jul-2010, approximately two years after the beginning of somatropin, the patient underwent an elective surgeries to insert a tube in one of his ear to equalize the pressure (unknown on which ear it was done on) and for a nose revision to help him breathe better. The reporter stated that the patient was not breathing better because he had a cleft lip and palate. It was also reported that patient had a lapse in the somatropin therapy due to not being able to afford it. On unknown date, he took it sporadically for over eight months. He was using up medication that he had left over from previous cartridges, but was using cartridges that were still within the 28 day period. In Feb-2012, the patient underwent another elective surgery to equalize the pressure in his other ear (the reporter could not remember which ear). The surgeries to equalize the pressure in his ear and surgery for nose revision to help him breathe better were considered medically significant by the company. Information regarding corrective treatment and patient outcome was unknown. The somatropin therapy was continued. In a follow up report received on 14Jan2013 from the physician, it was reported that the surgeries were all elective and were due to the CHARGE syndrome with craniofacial abnormalities the patient had since birth. This case was determined to be non-valid for no adverse events and will be deleted from the database. 

Update 21Jan2013: Additional information was received from a physician on 14Jan2013: Added new physician reporter, patient demographics (ethnicity, height, weight), updated history to include CHARGE syndrome, removed events of ear surgeries and surgery for nose to help him breathe better as they were related to a pre-existing condition and the surgeries were elective (downgraded case to non-serious/non-valid).</narrativeincludeclinical>
