-MRI Brain with and without contrast: Dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the confluence of the sinuses, right transverse and petrous sinus, caudally to the level of the proximal jugular vein. The MR imaging features overall are consistent with a cast of the deoxyhemoglobin, indicating acute thrombosis, probably less than three days in age. No associated, venous infarction is identified. The sagittal and straight sinuses are widely patent at this time. Multiple T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensities consistent with the patient's known diagnosis of
multiple sclerosis.

On 05-Dec-2008, on annual exam, patient was premenopausal. Her LMP was 11/19/2008. The patient's menses were regular. They occurred on every 23 days, last 4 days, and were light to medium without clots. She did not have spotting. She was not using contraception at this time.

On 17-Dec-2008, patient had headache, facial numbness and tingling would like to consult with the physician. Patient had been diagnosed with a venous vein thrombosis. Neurology was going to see her. Patient with history of multiple sclerosis and migraines presented with complaints of headache that started 4 hours prior to admission. Apparently, the patient was doing well previously. There was no history of any head injury. The pain started all of a sudden in left temple at around 11:30 in the morning and it spread all over the head. It was 9/10 in severity and the headache was persistent and constant. There was nothing that relieves the pain and there was nothing specific that aggravates the pain. It was just persistent right from its onset and it was also associated with some nausea and photophobia and left side facial numbness and left arm numbness. There was no weakness of extremity. She had no loss of consciousness, no seizures, no fever, no vomiting, no visual or speech disturbances. Past medical history included multiple sclerosis, diagnosed in 2006; depression; and migraines.

Yaz was started by her gynecologist recently 2 weeks ago, after she failed other therapies for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Impression was RIGHT TRANSVERSE SINUS THROMBOSIS likely secondary to recent institution of estrogen therapy. MRI Brain with and without contrast revealed DURAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS INVOLVING THE CONFLUENCE OF THE SINUSES, RIGHT TRANSVERSE AND PETROUS SINUS, CAUDALLY TO THE LEVEL OF THE PROXIMAL JUGULAR VEIN.
On 21-Dec-2008, CTA of Brain revealed There was a filling defect within the inferior aspect of the supC)rior sagittal sinus consistent with thrombus, THROMBUS IN  BILATERAL TRANSVERSE SINUSES. Portions of this thrombus appeared hyperdense on the noncontrast CT consistent with more acute thrombus. 
On 22-Dec-2008, MRI Brain with and without contrast revealed persistent THROMBUS INVOLVING THE RIGHT TRANSVERSE AND SIGMOID SINUSES. NEW THROMBUS IN THE MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT TRANSVERSE SINUS AND THE INFERIOR ASPECT OF THE SUPERIOR SAGITTAL SINUS. THE THROMBUS ALSO EXTENDS INTO THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 2. there was no evidence of acute infarct in the brain, no intracranial hemorrhage.
On 23-Dec-2008, as per discharge summary, patient got admitted on 17-Dec-2008. Discharge diagnoses were 1. CEREBRAL VEIN SINUS THROMBOSIS. 2. Multiple sclerosis. 3. Depression. 4. History of migraines. Brief Hospital Course included the patient with a history of migraine and multiple sclerosis who presented with acute onset of severe diffuse headache along with some nausea, photophobia, left-sided facial numbness, or left arm numbness. MRI and MRV revealed dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the confluence of the sinuses, RIGHT TRANSVERSE
AND PETROSUS SINUS TO THE LEVEL OF THE PROXIMAL JUGULAR VEIN. MRI and MRV revealed also signal hyperintensity consistent with the patient's history of multiple sclerosis. The patient was started on IV heparin and Coumadin, heparin was gradually discontinued, and the patient had therapeutic INR on Coumadin on the day of discharge. The patient's preceding estrogen contraceptive therapy was discontinued as well as it was given their possible contribution to headaches, particularly migraines. Hypercoagulability workup was initiated including PT was slightly low at 9.1, INR was 0.6, PTT was low normal at 24, protein S was normal at 75, protein C was high at 240, Antithrombin III was normal at 104 and factor V Leiden mutation pending. The patient was treated with Lortab and Toradol as needed for headache. Prior to discharge the patient had a repeat MRI and MRV of the brain, which per radiology and neurology showed some improvement. She was cleared for discharge with strict emergency precautions by neurology. Discharge medications included 1. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily; #30; no refill.2. Lortab 5 per 500 mg 1 tab p.o. q.4-6h. as needed for severe pain; #12; no refill. 3. Copaxone 20 mg subcutaneously daily. 4. Wellbutrin XL 300 mg p.o. Daily.
On 09-Jan-2009, on follow up, patient was discharged on 23-Dec-2008 after presentation to hospital with sever headache, found to have large CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS, she on Coumadin. Cause of thrombosis was [questionable] BCP - [birth control pill] 2 weeks prior. Assessment was CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS , MS [multiple sclerosis] and depression.
On 25-Mar-2009, she was hospitalized in Dec-2008. At that time she developed a headache and left face and arm numbness. The headache was quite severe and there was some alteration in mental status at that time. She was taken by ambulance to emergency room where she was admitted she was anticoagulated, and she stated that she had a 'blood clot' on the brain. It sounded that she had a CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS. She seemed to have done very well clinically from that. Impression was patient had recent CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS (presumptive diagnosis based on her description of events and treatment rendered - no records from this event) [as written], felt to be related to YAZ.
On 14-Apr2009, impression was multiple sclerosis, relapsing remitting appears to be stable clinically and on MRL She still was in somewhat deconditioned state, following her hospitalization for CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS, felt to be related to estrogen treatment, and migraineur. she remained on Coumadin. 
On 21-Jul-2009, patient was found to have a RIGHT TRANSVERSE SINUS VEIN THROMBOSIS EXTENDING TO THE JUGULAR VEIN. According to records no coagulation problems were found, although it was noted that her protein C activity was elevated, but couldnot make out the exact elevation. Her anti-cardiolipin antibodies were negative, antithrombin III was negative, and factor V Laden Leiden was negative. She was heparinized and was placed on Coumadin and had been on Coumadin since then. Her prothrombin times had been followed by the anticoagulation clinic. She was having no migraines. She had an occasional discomfort in her left temporal region that was associated with noise. She did have difficulty with word finding at times and that caused some issues. Impression was she was status post CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS, (RIGHT TRANSVERSE SINUS VEIN THROMBOSIS EXTENDING INTO THE JUGULAR VEIN).This was felt to be related to estrogen treatment in a migraineur. [as written]. MRV was normal with no suggestion of thrombosis.
On 19-Jan-2010, impression was patient was status post RIGHT TRANSVERSE SINUS VEIN THROMBOSIS, which was felt to be related to brief use of hormone therapy with normal hematology work-up. She was status post Coumadin therapy. Plan was she had been on over 6 months of anticoagulation following her CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS. If indeed there was no underlying problem with hypercoagulable state, then Coumadin could be safely discontinued.
On 16-Feb-2011, on annual exam, the patient was premenopausal and her menses were irregular. She had no current complaints. She was using BCP's for contraception [as written]. She had history of JUGULAR THROMBOSES, couldnot take hormones, vaginal mucous cyst at outlet. Past surgical history included Cholecystectomy.

				<sendercomment>BAYER GLOBAL COMMENT: 
This case report was received from an attorney/ Medical Records on behalf of a 47 years old female patient, who was prescribed Yaz (drospirenone and ethinylestradiol) and experienced CEREBRAL VEIN SINUS THROMBOSIS.
The event is serious due to hospitalization, listed event in the reference safety Information for Yaz.

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between the use of COCs and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases such as CVA, DVT and PE. These events occur rarely and the risk is highest during the first year of use.
In this particular case, patient has significant medical history of migraines, vitamin B12 deficiency, benign breast lesion, obesity, increased cholesterol and positive family history of stroke.
These are the risk factors for the reported event and could be an alternative explanation for the occurrence of the event.
Temporal relationship is positive between CEREBRAL VEIN SINUS THROMBOSIS and Yaz, so causality cannot be excluded.
Further information is expected during litigation process.</sendercomment>
