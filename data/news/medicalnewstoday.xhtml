<div itemprop="articleBody"><b>The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is investigating whether or not the Type 2 Diabetes
drugs Januvia (from Merck) and Byetta (from Bristol-Myers Squibb)
are associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatic
cancer.</b><br/>
<br/>
 Close to 25 million people in the United States have <a href="/info/diabetes/" title="What is Diabetes?" class="keywords">diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257363.php">costing the
country an estimated $245 billion a year</a>. There's been a huge
rise in the number of treatment options over the last few years.
Many patients have to take more than one drug to stabilize their
blood sugar levels and insulin.<br/>
<br/>
 However, the safety of all these new diabetes medications is still
under thorough investigation, the FDA informs.<br/>
<br/>
 Data from <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257103.php">a report in
<i>JAMA's Internal Medicine</i> indicated that patients who took
the diabetes drugs Januvia and Byetta were at a much greater risk
of developing pancreatitis</a> compared to those who didn't.<br/>
<br/>
 Januvia is an oral antihyperglycemic, it is either used alone or
in combination with other oral antihyperglycemic agents, such as
metmorfin. Byetta is a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist administered
twice a day as a subcutaneous injection.<br/>
<br/>
 <b>The FDA is looking at all the medications belonging to a class
of drugs called incretin mimetics</b> (which includes Victoza and
others), which stimulate the production of insulin.<br/>
<br/>
 Following the results of a study carried out last month that
analyzed insurance records, Merck and Bristol were quick to state
the safety of their drugs. Merck even said they found "no
compelling evidence establishing a causal relationship" between
Januvia and <a href="/articles/160459.php" title="What is chronic pancreatitis? What causes chronic pancreatitis?" class="keywords">pancreatitis</a> or <a href="/info/pancreatic-cancer/" title="What is Pancreatic Cancer?" class="keywords">pancreatic cancer</a>.<br/>
<br/>
 In 2007, the FDA added information to the labels of Byetta about
its association with pancreatitis and in 2009 the agency did the
same with Januvia and Janumet.<br/>
<br/>
 The FDA said:<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote>"The FDA has not concluded these drugs may cause or
contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. At this time,
patients should continue to take their medicine as directed until
they talk to their health care professional."</blockquote>
<br/>
 Some analysts believe that the investigation won't have much of an
impact on the sales of the drug, given that past investigations
haven't resulted in drastic changes. They believe that the most the
FDA will do is add more warnings about the increased risk of
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.<br/>
<br/>
 Merck would be impacted the most by the findings; last year the
drug Januvia generated sales of more than $4 billion and it's
sister drug Janumet generated a further $1.65 billion for the
company.<br/>
<br/>
 The drug Byetta only generated sales of $310 million last year for
the three companies that share the drug; BMS, AstraZeneca and Eli
Lilly.<br/>
<br/>
 The FDA concluded:<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote>"At this time, patients should continue to take their
medicine as directed until they talk to their health care
professional, and health care professionals should continue to
follow the prescribing recommendations in the drug
labels."</blockquote>
