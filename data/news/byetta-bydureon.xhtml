<p>Byetta and Bydureon are injectable drugs used to control blood
sugar in people with Type 2 diabetes. They are linked to
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, which have led to lawsuits.</p>
</div>
<p>Byetta (exenatide injection) is a twice-daily injectable drug
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
<a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/actos/treating-type-2-diabetes-with-medication/">
treatment of Type 2 diabetes</a>. The drug is designed to work with
diet and exercise to control blood sugar. Manufactured by San
Diego-based Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Byetta was approved by the FDA
in 2005. In January 2012, the FDA approved a once-weekly exenatide
injection called Bydureon – a longer-lasting version of Byetta. The
FDA previously rejected it twice in 2010 because of evidence that
the drug may cause heart rhythm abnormalities. In 2012, <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturer/bristol-myers-squibb/">Bristol-Myers
Squibb</a> purchased Amylin for about $5.3 billion.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14982" src="http://js.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/byetta.jpg" alt="Byetta" width="270" height="234"/></p>
<p>Exenatide is part of a class of drugs called glucagonlike
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These drugs mimic the effects
of the body’s natural GLP-1, a hormone that reacts to high blood
sugar by increasing insulin production. The synthetic hormone is
derived from the saliva of a poisonous lizard called the Gila
monster that is found in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>Byetta generates the majority of Amylin’s yearly sales and in
2011 accounted for $517.7 million (83 percent) of the company’s
$621.6 million net sales. Industry analysts expect sales of
Bydureon to exceed $1 billion. The drug also costs more than many
other oral diabetes medications currently on the market such as
<a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/actos/">Actos (pioglitazone)</a>
or <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/januvia/">Januvia
(sitagliptin)</a>. Byetta and Bydureon typically cost close to
$500 a month, but actual prices may vary depending on the
patient’s insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Doctors typically prescribe Byetta or Bydureon to overweight
<a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/actos/type-2-diabetes/">people
with Type 2 diabetes</a>, because the drug also seems to help with
weight loss. People taking only Byetta lost an average of six
pounds over 24 weeks, although the drug is not marketed as a
weight-loss product.</p>
<p>In three 30-week clinical trials, people who took Byetta had an
average reduction of 1 percent in A1C – the amount of glucose
concentrated in a person’s blood – after three years of treatment,
and the drug was effective in managing Type 2 diabetes. However,
the drug once proclaimed as an incredible advancement in diabetes
medication is now linked to disturbing side effects like <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/diabetes/pancreatitis/">pancreatitis</a>,
pancreatic cancer and thyroid cancer. People who took Byetta and
their families have since pursued litigation against Amylin and Eli
Lilly, who helped market the drug.</p>
<h2>How Does Byetta Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14983" src="http://css.drugwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/how-byetta-works.jpg" alt="How Byetta Works" width="318" height="285"/>Byetta is
packaged in a glass cartridge inside a pen-injector. A doctor or
physician’s assistant instructs patients how to inject it. The
active ingredient, exenatide, is mixed in water along with an
antimicrobial agent.</p>
<p>Two prefilled pens come with either a 5 mcg or 10 mcg dose, and
each prefilled pen delivers a 30-day supply of Byetta that should
be administered twice a day. Byetta can be used alone or with
metformin, a sulfonylurea (Amaryl, Glocotrol), a thiazolidinedione
(Actos, Avandia), or Lantus (insulin glargine). It can also be used
with DPP-4 inhibitors like Januvia. It should not be used in people
with Type 1 diabetes, however.</p>
<p>In healthy people, eating causes a rise in blood glucose and
stimulates an insulin response from the pancreas. People with
diabetes do not produce enough insulin to react to an increase in
blood sugar. Byetta helps insulin production to regulate sugar
levels.</p>

</div>
<h3>Clinical Studies</h3>
<p>Scientists conducted three 30-week, controlled clinical trials
to test the effectiveness of Byetta in controlling blood glucose.
In the trials, 1,446 patients whose blood sugar was poorly
controlled while taking metformin alone, a sulfonylurea alone or a
combination of the two were given Byetta or a placebo.</p>
<p>Results revealed that patients taking Byetta had reductions in
HbA1C and reduced blood glucose, both during fasting and after
eating. In addition, study participants in the Byetta group also
lost weight.</p>
<h3>Byetta for Weight Loss</h3>
<p>Another way Byetta may help people with diabetes is by
stimulating weight loss. Many people with Type 2 diabetes are
overweight or obese. This increases their risk of diabetes-related
complications such as heart disease or stroke. Along with lifestyle
changes, Byetta is shown to help people with diabetes lose weight
and better control their blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In a May 2010 study published in The American Journal of
Medicine, researchers recruited 194 overweight or obese patients
with Type 2 diabetes. They administered Byetta to one group and a
placebo to the other. People who took Byetta lost more weight than
those who did not. According to Amylin’s research, the average
amount of weight loss for people who took the drug with another
diabetes medication was four pounds over 30 weeks. Those who took
Byetta alone lost six pounds over 24 weeks.</p>
<p>Byetta is so effective at inducing weight loss that some people
without diabetes are using it as a diet drug. Amylin and Eli Lilly
say they do not encourage the “off-label” use – use not approved by
the FDA – of the drug, but they funded studies of Byetta for weight
loss in people with normal blood sugar. These studies showed Byetta
is effective at promoting weight loss even in healthy individuals.
However, the long-term use of exenatide has not been tested in
people without diabetes, and doctors caution that it may be
dangerous.</p>
<h2>Serious Side Effects</h2>
<p>There are reports of several side effects and complications
related to Byetta and Bydureon, including some that require
hospitalization and may be fatal. The most serious side effects are
linked to damage of the pancreas, kidneys and thyroid.</p>
<h3>Pancreatitis</h3>
<p>Pancreatitis is a medical condition that causes the pancreas to
become inflamed and swell. Severe cases can lead to hospitalization
and even death – with a mortality rate of 10 to 30 percent.
According to data gathered from the FDA and compiled by the
Institute of Safe Medication Practices, there were more than 400
reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis in 2011 resulting from
exenatide.</p>
<p>Data also reveal that pancreatitis is 49 times more likely to be
reported in Byetta and Bydureon users than in patients who take
other drugs in the same class.</p>
<p>In a 2011 study published in <i>Gastroenterology</i>,
researchers found that people who took Byetta were six times more
likely to report pancreatitis. The results were consistent with
animal studies that also revealed an increased risk.</p>
<p>As a result of the increasing reports of pancreatitis in users
of Byetta, the FDA required Amylin to conduct more postmarket
studies on the drug in 2009, but results have yet to be
reported.</p>

</div>
<p>This is a serious condition, and anyone who exhibits signs of
pancreatitis should seek medical attention immediately.
Pancreatitis can also lead to pancreatic cancer.</p>
<h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is a cancer with a low survival rate because
more than 80 percent of cases are diagnosed after tumors spread to
other organs. Long-term survival rates are exceedingly low: about
95 percent of people succumb to the disease within five years.</p>
<p>Exenatide is linked to an <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/diabetes/pancreatic-cancer/">increase in
pancreatic cancer</a>. The same 2011 study published in
Gastroenterology revealed that there was an almost three-fold
increase in reported cases of pancreatic cancer in users of
Byetta.</p>
<h3>Thyroid Cancer</h3>
<p>The thyroid is a gland that is located in the neck, just above
the collarbone. It makes hormones that are necessary for regulating
the body’s metabolism, including how fast calories burn and how
fast the heart beats. Depending on a number of factors, the thyroid
may produce too many or too few hormones, causing weight gain or
loss, rapid heartbeat and sensitivity to cold or hot temperatures.
The thyroid can also develop cancer.</p>
<p>Clinical study results linked Byetta to thyroid cancer. One
study conducted by Michael Elashoff and colleagues at the
University of California, Los Angeles and published in
<i>Gastroenterology</i> revealed that people who used Byetta were
almost five times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than those
who took another diabetes medication, <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/avandia/">Avandia
(rosiglitazone)</a>.</p>
<p>A review conducted by doctors at National Taiwan University
College of Medicine and published in <i>Experimental Diabetes
Research</i> found that Byetta increased the number of cancerous
cells in the thyroids of mice, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System database supported an increased risk of thyroid cancer
associated with the drug.</p>
<h2>Other Side Effects</h2>
<p>In 2009, the FDA required Amylin to add the risk of kidney
damage and failure to Byetta’s warning label. Exenatide was also
linked to cardiovascular events such as heart attack. A 2008 study
was done in Canada for risk of cardiovascular events, which Amylin
attempted to withhold from the FDA. This delayed the release of
Bydureon for several years, until the drug was approved in 2012
with the condition that Amylin conduct postmarket studies.</p>

<h2>Byetta Lawsuits</h2>
<p>Because of reports of hundreds of cases of pancreatitis and some
fatal cases of pancreatic cancer, several individuals and families
pursued litigation against Amylin and Eli Lilly for failure to
warn, negligence and concealing the side effects of Byetta.</p>
<p>Among them is Guy Riley, surviving heir of Kathleen Riley. He
filed a lawsuit on her behalf in the Superior Court of California
in San Diego after she died from pancreatic cancer after taking
Byetta with Januvia. His complaint alleges that Kathleen Riley
suffered “severe physical, economic and emotional injuries” as a
result of taking Byetta. The Rileys were unaware that Byetta
carried a risk of pancreatic cancer because Amylin and Eli Lilly
failed to warn the public.</p>
